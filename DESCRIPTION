Title: Builds GLM ensemble models in parallel
Version: 0.2.0
Authors@R: person("Alex", "Whitworth", email = "whitworth.alex@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package trains and tests GLM ensemble models with backward variable  selection via AIC. Holdout testing data is first selected and then ensemble elements are trained on training datasets via resampling from the non-holdout data. The following family-link functions are supported: binomial-logit, binomial-probit, poisson-log, gaussian-identity. Resulting ensemble coefficients are weighted by accuracy on test data. By default, ensemble elements are built in parallel.
